It isn't a Artic Monkeys's Official Website. The pictures, images, icons and the Artic Monkeys's image don't are mine. Github's and Email's svg by Bootstrap. Logos of another trendmarks don't are mine: NME's, Github's, Grammy's, Gaffa's and Brit's are their right. This work is a demonstration of my habilities and isn't a comercial work, just a personal learning work. The images were found on Duckduckgo images search engine. And the references are in the footer.
